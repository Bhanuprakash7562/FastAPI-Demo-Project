The Main Structure:
    main.py
        |--> app
        |--> models.declarative_base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine) it is for creating database objects from python objects derived in schemas.py(models.py)
        |--> class classname(BaseModel) this is for getting data through post request payload or getting query parameters
        |-->@app.post/get/put/delete methods actual functions
            |--> In the funtion parameters def create(abc : classname, db : Session(imported from sqlalchemy.orm) = Depends(function derived in database.py file which passes sessionmaker method as db) Depends is a method from fastapi)
            |--> newdata = calling python class object of db from schemas.py/models.py schemas.Blog(col1 = abc.key1, col2 = abc.key2, col3 = abc.key3)
            |--> inserting data to data -- db.add(newdata); db.commit(); db.refresh(newdata); return newdata.
    
    database.py -- Configuring database
        |--> importing create_engine from sqlalchemy and Session, sessionmaker from sqlalchemy.orm
        |--> creating db_url
        |--> creating db_engine by passing db_url
        |--> creating session by sessionmaker method by passing db engine
        |--> defining get_db function to yield session created by sessionmaker method
    
    schemas.py or models.py -- Defining db table structure in python class object form
        |--> import Column and datatype classes from sqlalchemy
        |--> import declarative_base from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative
        |--> create base from declarative_base
        |--> define table class with Columns by mentioning datatypes of Columns


Authentication and Autherization:
API Keys:
	Step 1 :- Static API keys will be defined in application server and will be shared privately with client.
	Step 2 :- Client server will call the application server API endpoints by passing the API keys in headers.
	Step 3 :- Application verifies the API keys sent by the client, If they are valid application gives the response otherwise raises error response.
JWT:
	Step 1 :- User logins with credentials(Username/Password).
	Step 2 :- Application checks the credentials are exists or not. If exists a JWT will be generated with the respective access to the endpoints and 		  expiry. Then it will be sent back to user.
	Step 3 :- User stores the JWT in cache or local system.
	Step 4 :- User calls the respective API endpoints with payload and JWT in headers.
	Step 5 :- Application verifies that JWT is valid or not, if it is valid it allows the api call otherwise raises an HTTP error response.
OAuth:
	defination:- Giving Access for the resources in the Application server to third party applications without sharing the User credentials directly.
	Step 1 :- User request access to thrid party application and this third party applications requires logging in.
	Step 2 :- Instead of creating new account in this third party application, we can request for OAuth code from the third party application to 		  our application server.
	Step 3 :- Upon granting permission to the request in Application server an OAuth Code will be generated using the existing credentials in 		  Application server.
	Step 4 :- OAuth Code will be sent back to the third party application, So that it will exchage this OAuth code for access token with Application 		  	  server.
	Step 5 :- Third Party App will use this Access token to access the resources from application server.
